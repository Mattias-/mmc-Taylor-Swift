This is team Taylor Swift's monkey that made it to the finals of [Monkey Music Challenge](http://www.monkeymusicchallenge.com/)

Be careful. The monkey is agressive...

**How to run**

1. Clone the repo.

2. Make sure you got python and dependencies like requests...
3. Export some environment variables

    ```bash
    export MMC_TEAM_NAME="Team Name"
    export MMC_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    ```
4.  Join game 55 with the monkey

    ```bash
    ./run 55
    ```
 
5.  Challenge yourself in game 55

    ```bash
    ./run_2 55
    ```

**Approach**

 1. Get some points
 2. Make life miserably for the other monkey.
 3. Pray we got more points than the opponent when the game ends.
